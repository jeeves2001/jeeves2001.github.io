Preperation 
- Does it need to be a meeting, could it be done via Teams / Slack of (shock) email? 
- minimize no. of attendees, more people = more expensive + less decisions made
- Agenda, ALWAYS send out an agenda in advance of the meeting, as far in advance as possible. 
- - Time slots with names, then everyone knows what they need to do & why they are there 
- Send out preperation material, make sure everyone understand to read this before the meeting, we do not have meetings to read documents! 

In the meeting 
- Tell people why they are there
- Keep to time 
- Make notes (I copy the agenda into OneNote and then can write notes directly using the BoJo notation
- At the end of the meeting review all the agreed actions and timescales 

After the meeting 
- Send out email (Teams / Slack) with the notes and clearly assigned actions 
- side not all actions need to be assigned to a specific person and have a due date 
- chase one week later to ensure progress
