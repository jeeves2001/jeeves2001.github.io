Fist seen the idea in a video by [Matthijs Diederiks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYZcv_2egGV4tM8ar4dr4Ag/featured) in which he talks about not just transparency but also about outsorcing his [decision making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvMMfV9K0Pc). While this is / was an extream example, the idea was captivating (also, his videos are just plain awesome). 
Then I stumbled accross [Joe Reddington](https://github.com/joereddington)'s post on [making his todo list public](https://joereddington.com/6232/2016/08/26/my-to-do-list-is-now-public-and-its-the-most-useful-thing-ive-done-in-years./). I'd actually hear Joe speak at a conference a few years ago and had followed him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joereddington) ever since. 
This has lead me to re-think my own productivity and begin my own strive for more public transparency and accountability. To that end I have transfered my to do list to [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) and [uploaded my todo list to Github](https://github.com/jeeves2001/Todo.txt). I've also published a couple of public projects about moving house and getitng a new job (more on that last one later).
