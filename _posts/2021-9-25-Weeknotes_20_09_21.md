Among my other fitness and health goals I've been doing a bit of research into what vitamins I should be taking to keep things in tip top shape. This last week I've been trying [Vegums](https://www.vegums.com/), both the multivitamin and the fish free omega-3. So far so good, although as with all other vitamins I've had, they only work if you remember to take them! 

With exercise and meditation (for me) comes getting back into the [Wim Hof Method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/) and I've been loving catching up with his new [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-wim-hof-podcast/id1570594714). While some may find him over the top (he is crazy by his own admission!) I find the method itself extremely valuable, both for fitness and meditation. I'm even considering getting myself an [ice bath](https://www.celtictimber.co.uk/product/barrels-for-ice-baths/) as my shower never really gets cold enough. 

I stumbled across [this article](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/pooping-without-your-phone) last week and it really made me think. Yes, I often take my phone to the bathroom, and yes, it often means I spend longer in there than actually required (maybe TMI?). So I've made the conscious choice to stop this habit. Unfortunately, at least for now, this means I just think about what I could be looking at on my phone instead... maybe I have a deeper problem? 

This week I'm continuing to experiment with delaying my coffee intake until at least 90 minuets after waking. This has had the benefit of encouraging me to drink quite a bit more water in the mornings, which I have noticed has had a dramatic impact on my mood (making me much less tense). I've also started substituting a [Titanium Tea](https://brainflow.co/index.php/2018/04/03/tim-ferriss-titanium-tea-the-morning-cocktail-better-than-coffee/) for my first or second coffee which gives me a much smoother caffeine curve, similar to taking l-theanine (I obviously don't add the butter!). 

Finally this week I've been dithering over which ToDo list is best for me (yes, again). Recently I'be become a great fan of [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) but I'm also still clinging to [ToDo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli). I love the usability and portability of ToDo.txt, but I find the lack of mobile apps really limits my usage. Todoist on the other ad has apps for all the platforms I use, but it just _feels_ more limited... The battle continues. Annoyingly I've also started to really like using [Github Projects](https://github.com/jeeves2001?tab=projects) which is only making things even more complicated. 

Bonus: I've updated my [reading list](https://github.com/users/jeeves2001/projects/4) for 2021, and I'm quite please with my progress so far! 

If you want to see more stuff from me throughout the week, the best place is probably [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jeeves2001).
