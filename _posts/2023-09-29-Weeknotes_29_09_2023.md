Having to travel into the office quite a bit the last few weeks which has introduced me to some new people which has been great, although shocking as I've been there over two years now and am only just meeting some of these people! The increase in travel has got me looking at EV efficiency again. Thankfully I am lucky enough to be able to charge my car at work (for free!) and this week I'm managing to achieve a whopping 333 mile per kwh, just over the published WLTP rating of 328, which I'm pretty pleased with.

Being in the office more I have perfected my in-office coffee making kit (Aeropress, pre ground coffee pots, and my beloved Keep Cup. I've also noticed this week that my regular Pact (coffee) delivery is now in fully recyclable packaging so props to them!

I also noticed that Huel have release their 'Essential' powder which I've been testing this last week. For me it hits the requirement, especially for breakfast on those, all to frequent days in the office. Again, I'm not sure how long this has been the case, but I've noticed that the Huel bags (the Essentials one at least) is not only made from recycled materials but is also completely recyclable, which is fantastic. 

Other stuff I've been playing with this week: 

I have found the all-time best use for ChatGPT; taking the contents of my kitchen and suggesting meals and cocktails.

At work I've been messing about trying to find the right mix of tools for task tracking. We tend to use Planner and DevOps, while I'm fond of Microsoft ToDo, though its still missing a key feature for me, the ability to report on tasks completed that day / week. I haven't even found a way to get at this info with Power Automate. Admittedly, I havenâ€™t really spent enough time on it.   

I've updated my [reading list](https://github.com/users/jeeves2001/projects/4) this week and am, frankly, amazed at the number of books I've managed to get through the last couple of years. Yes, Audible is _expensive_ but, in my opinion, is well worth it, especially on those longer commutes or solo dog walks. 

I'm excitedly using my new Samsung Buds 2 Pro, which work perfectly with my Fold 4 and Flip 5 (yes I have a thing for folding phones). Being able to play music on the phone and managing playback and volume on my watch makes me understand the appeal of ecosystem lock in. I wonder if I'll by typing this on a Galaxy book next....
