My current role is generally more strategic these days so there aren't that many chances to get my hand dirty. This week however I've been lucky enough to start playing with some new Microsoft Teams equipment we are thinking of deploying (which is awesome, by the way) and do a bit of 'no code' automation with good old Power Automate. This is quite exciting and I have found it difficult to resist getting pulled back into this sort of thing, as an alternative to spending 5+ hours every day in meetings! 

On the fitness front I'm looking increasingly at the option of doing a Sprint or Olympic Triathlon. To that end I'm back to spending at least 3 hours a week down at the local pool. This has reminded me that, while I can swim, I don't really know _how_ to swim efficiently. The first step for me is to simply spend more time in the water getting used to it. Just one week has me feeling a bit more comfortable and a bit less, [constantly out of breath and feeling generally weak](https://www.strava.com/athletes/32743784)!  

I'm also addicted to watching [The Unlazy Way on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_azWRsdYDhKonquMlAMfQ). Its both hilarious and motivating. 

I had a mental break through this week while out walking the dog. Normally I have a standard, extendable dog lead, but when I'm out running I have a belt with attachable lead. And I thought "why don't I just use this, all the time?". This has changed my life, and I haven't spilt my morning coffee once this week while trying to stop my dog eating the neighbors cat. 

This last week I've been lucky enough to attend the Gartner symposium, not lucky enough to fly to Barcelona, but you can't have everything. There were a number of fantastic talks, I especially liked the keynote with [Rachel Botsman](https://twitter.com/rachelbotsman) and [Adam Grant](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant) and the keynote by [Rolf Dobelli](https://www.dobelli.com/), although I think he should probably just park his car in the right place and keep that money for charity! Hearing all these great speakers has added a number of books to my, already over flowing, [reading list](https://github.com/users/jeeves2001/projects/4) for 2021. I suspect this will be an ongoing theme.
